  - ~~nojs navigation not working~~
  - ~~footer content~~
    - ~~see: social links above as part of it~~

- Idea:

  - Implement an Astro ??? to implement the layout of https://diataxis.fr/reference/
  - Fundamentals first:
    - Use tailwind vars everywhere for consistency
      - Own src/styles/css files
      - <style></style> sections in components
    - Streamline the use of tailwind
      - Make sure repeating combinations are abstracted out
        - How?
  - Make sure we have full control over responsiveness
    - sm: phone
      - collapse left and right
    - md: tablet / small screen
      - collapse right
    - lg: desktop
      - collapse none

- Projects

  - ~~Content collection per project?~~
  - Content collection for all projects
  - A project is a top-level folder inside `content/projects`
  - Need to auto-index all project content
    - Files in sub-folders [is this needed for first version?]
    - Heading levels within files
      - Can we use: https://github.com/vcarl/remark-headings [?]
  - Need to generate navigation for project content
    - Similar to starlight: sidebar with files/folders; right-hand bar with in-page navigation [?]
  - See: https://diataxis.fr/reference/
    - Left nav slides out, right nav slides out (on small screens)
    - Right nav is collapsed first on medium screens
  - Can we re-use some features of starlight?
    - Code rendering, diffs/etc?
    - Search?

- TODO

  - ~~Metadata~~
    - ~~Format readable date properly~~
    - ~~Use proper name for author?~~
    - ~~Remove email from author?~~
    - ~~Better icons?: https://lucide-astro.dzeio.com/~~
  - ~~Tag index pages~~
  - ~~TIL index page~~
  - ~~Selected items for MainNavigation~~
  - Comments/feedback for TIL posts
    - https://elazizi.com/posts/add-comments-section-to-your-astro-blog/
  - Projects index page
    - Project page template
      - More like a documentation style
      - Can we somehow use/leverage starlight here?
        - This is a tradeoff:
          - PRO: very good documentation features, responsive, light/dark, auto-index doc folder trees
          - CON: not designed to be per-project, more like for a standalone site
          - CON: will need a lot of hacking to make it fit with the rest of the site design
            - QUESTION: is this hacking worth it, or should we go to the effort of creating our own implementation?

- RSS feed?
  - Just for TIL?
  - Could have separate one for tags?
- Accessibility?
- PGP signatures
  - Could make an Astro integration?
    - Project/TIL material
- Search?
- Sitemap?

- Add navigation:
  - Home
  - Projects
  - TIL
    - tags
      - (or should these be top-level, for any content, e.g. projects, etc?)
      - but then projects would also have to be content collections?
        - Can content collections be metadata only and refer to pages?
  - About
    - Contact
- ~~Hamburger menu~~
- Add some TIL posts
- Add skeleton project pages?
  - ???
